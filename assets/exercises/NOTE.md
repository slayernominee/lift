This is a fork of an older version of ExerciseDB by ASCENDAPI.

Although this being under the AGPL-3.0 License, I asked them if I can use this fork and they allowed it.
So many thanks to them for enabled this whole project even in the current scope with all these cool animations etc.

Here is their Website: https://www.ascendapi.com/
formerly: https://exercisedb.dev

So if you need access to an Exercise DB, consider using their API if you can (this App has a strong focus on offline functionality, so not the case here). They even provide way more exercises than here.

Thanks :)
